= Work Status indicator

My simple door indicator for the home office.

== Hardware

* WeMos D1 mini plus
* OLED Shield 0.66" 64x48
* (optional) Case: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3450373

== Features

Right now this is pretty simple and maybe will stay the way it is for a while ;)

The built-in webserver will expose:

* _http://d1-ip/call_ for displaying the phone icon
* _http://d1-ip/code_ for displaying the keyboard icon
* _http://d1-ip/free_ for displaying the open door icon

== Possible upcoming features

* Use a larger display
* Add light indicator
